Azure Data Services, Security & Governance tools
Lakehouse architecture - raw, semi structured, unstructured data
Power BI reporting
Automated data pipeline - automate E2E data platform solution

##Tools
Data Factory
Synapse Analytics

##Architecture
On-prem SQL Server DB
Common usecase - migrate traditional DB to cloud

Data Factory  //Ingestion
ETL tool
DF connects to on-prem server
copy tables from DB & move to Data Lake

Databricks  //transform data to cleanest form

##Data Lake (gen 2)
Bronze layer - raw data, source of truth, staging
Silver layer - some data transformations
Gold layer - cleanest curated data

Synapse Analytics //Load the cleaned data to DB
Create DB and tables
Migrated data
Acting as cloud SQL server

***Data has been completely migrated


Power BI  //Reporting
Further analysis on data stored in Synapse Analytics
Data reporting with visualizations, DAX and publishing to service

Active Directory (Entra ID)
Identity access mgmt
Service principal

Key Vault
Store all the secrets
